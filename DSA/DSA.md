# Data Structures and Algorithms

This is my directory for exploring common data structures, and algorithms that you would find in
a typical Leetcode or other competitive programming problem

Here is the resource I will be using https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dsa-tutorial-learn-data-structures-and-algorithms/
Here are is a youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/@randerson112358

And here is playlist of the best Competitive Programmers in the world:
